# Hybrid-Based-Network-Intrusions-Detection-Systems

Welcome to the "Hybrid-Based-Network-Intrusions-Detection-Systems by Snort" GitHub repository! This repository hosts a comprehensive project that focuses on the development and implementation of a hybrid network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using the renowned Snort intrusion detection software.

Project Overview:

In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyber threats is paramount. This project delves into the realm of network security, specifically the creation of a hybrid-based intrusion detection system that combines the strengths of signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods.

Key Features:

Hybrid Detection Approach: We explore the synergy between signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of detecting network intrusions.

Snort Integration: Leveraging the power of Snort, a widely-used open-source NIDS, we implement and customize the detection rules to identify known attack patterns and behaviors.

Anomaly Detection: Our system employs anomaly detection mechanisms to identify deviations from expected network behavior, offering heightened protection against zero-day attacks.

Real-time Monitoring: The project incorporates real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing swift identification and response to suspicious network activities.

Repository Contents:

Code: Find the source code for the hybrid-based intrusion detection system, including the custom Snort rules and anomaly detection components.

Documentation: Access detailed documentation, guides, and explanations on how to set up, configure, and deploy the system effectively.

Examples: Explore practical examples of the system in action, showcasing its ability to detect various types of network intrusions.

Why This Project Matters:

By combining the strengths of signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques, we aim to create a robust network intrusion detection system that is capable of identifying a wide range of threats. Our project empowers security enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals to gain insights into the world of hybrid detection methods, bolstering network security and promoting proactive defense against cyber threats.
